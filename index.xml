      <description>Compilers On the cluster we offer several C/C++/Fortran compilers through our modules system.
Below is given a short introduction to these and a few tips on how best to utilise them.
GNU Compiler Collection Intel Compiler Suite Portland Group Compiler Suite The best resource on using any of the PGI compilers is by reading their user guide, which can be found at http://www.pgroup.com/resources/docs.htm.
Advice and Tips Compiler Flags The PGI developers recommend that a few key flags be active for all compilations, specifically -fast -Mipa=fast,inline.</description>

      <description>The Cluster The cluster is made up of 1 head node and 10 compute nodes. Of the compute nodes, 8 are AMD based systems while the other 2 are Intel based systems. Here is the following hardware stack for all of the nodes:

      <description>How To Here we provide some guides for various aspects of using the Robotarium cluster. The most important ones are listed directly below &amp;mdash; it is a good idea to familiarise yourselves with these first. Please be aware that some of the guides here are hosted on other sites and will need you to navigate away from here.

      <description>Quick Start This guide provides a quick-n-dirty series of steps to get you started on the cluster. The guides assumes the following:
 you have an account on the cluster you have experience with Linux-based systems (especially the command line) you have a SSH public-private key pair  Alright then, lift off!
Accessing the Cluster (SSH) Open up your favourite terminal and type the following:
$ ssh &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;@robotarium.hw.ac.uk You can only access the cluster while inside the Heriot-Watt University network.</description>

      <description>Terms and Conditions Mains Points  No guarantee of service or quality is given; the cluster is provided as a free service to members and affiliates of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics with regular maintenance done by a small group of volunteers. Nonetheless some effort is made to ensure continuous uptime and availability. Very limited support is given; we only have a few volunteers at hand to help, and who themselves are busy doing their own work.</description>
